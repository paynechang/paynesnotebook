        Because of the nervous system, we can see, hear, smell, taste, feel, think, learn
        and act. Our brains keep processing a huge amount of information, even when we are
        sleeping. It is amazing how the brains calculate, make the decision, and send the
        commands to other parts of our bodies.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        Neurons are the fundamental unites in the nervous system. I am interested in studying
        how a neuron and a group of neurons process signals, store information, and function
        as a part of the nervous system.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        Specifically, my research aims to reveal mechanisms underlying the normal functions
        and disease states of the hippocampus. To this end, I have conducted research spanning
        the levels of dendrites, neurons, neural networks, and animal behaviors, while maintaining
        a strong relevance to the neuropathic and psychological conditions of the hippocampus.
        In the past, I have studied the spatial patterns of long-term potentiation and the
        propagation of epileptic activities in the hippocampus. Currently, my research focuses
        on two projects: (1) the unique role of dendritic Kv1.1 channels in signal processing
        and (2) enhanced hippocampal network activities in viral siRNA manipulated animals,
        which display vigorous anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like behaviors. I have used
        multiple imaging and electrophysiological techniques to examine the physiological
        and pathological conditions of the hippocampus. I believe that research focusing
        on these conditions with multiple techniques at different levels will clarify the
        mechanisms and guide the development of better treatments.</p>

        The hippocampus 
        <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus">[Wikipedia link]</a></sup> is a brain structure essential for learning, memory, and navigation.
        It is one of the main structures damaged in Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Neuropathic
        changes in the hippocampus can also lead to epilepsy and affective mood disorders,
        such as anxiety disorders and depression disorders. There are five major regions
        in a hippocampal slice, which are listed bellow.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dentate Gyrus (DG)</li>
        <li>CA3 Region</li>
        <li>CA2 Region</li>
        <li>CA1 Region</li>
        <li>Subiculum (SB)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="indent">
        There are several subregions labeled on the right.</p>

        The CA1 region is a model area to study synaptic properties because of two technical
        reasons. First, the field potential recording technique was the major method to
        study synaptic transmission in the past. Second, the apical dendrites of the CA1
        pyramidal neurons are uniformly arranged, making the interpretation of the field
        potential signals cleaner and straightforward. Due to this technical advantage,
        the CA1 region is one of the most well known areas in the mammalian brain.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        Following field potential recording, the sharp electrode recording and the whole
        cell patch-clamp recording were developed to monitor the intracellular membrane
        potential of individual cells. The whole cell patch-clamp recording technique is
        especially useful when scientists need to control local membrane potential or to
        evoke action potentials by current injection. Again, the CA1 pyramidal neurons were
        the choice of neuron models due to the relative homogeneous intrinsic properties
        and the better known synaptic properties. Another advantage is that their cell bodies
        were located in a thin layer, making it easiert to find healthy neurons under a
        microscope.</p>

                    If the fluorescence light passing a band-pass filter (green) is collected, an increase
                    in the light intensity will be observed (&Delta;F).</div>

        Voltage-sensitive dyes are chemicals, which can diffuse to the plasma membrane and
        change their optical properties in response to membrane potential change. There
        are two basic types of voltage-sensitive dyes: absorbance dyes and fluorescence
        dyes. The absorbance spectra and/or the fluorescence spectra of these dyes are altered
        when the strength and/or the polarity of the local electric field changes. By exciting
        the dyes and collecting transmitted/fluorescence light through a band-pass filter,
        the change in the light intensity reflects the change in the membrane potential.
        Within the physiological range of membrane potential, the relation between the membrane
        potential change and the light intensity change is quite linear. However, the change
        in light intensity is usually very small. There is generally 0.1 to 1 % change in
        light intensity in response to an action potential. Therefore, it is usually necessary
        to repeat the experiment a few times and calculate the averge to get a better signal
        to noise ratio. In addition, analog/digital temporal or spatial filters are often
        used to improve the quality of the signals.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        Using voltage-sensitive dyes to image membrane potential change is called voltage-sensitive
        dye imaging, or voltage imaging in short. It is a very powerful tool to study spatiotemporal
        characteristics of membrane potential change in single cells or in a brain slice.
        To study membrane potential change in different compartments of a neuron, the dye
        is ofter added to the internal solution to stain one neuron with the whole-cell
        patch clamp technique. To study ensemble membrane potential change at the neural
        network level, the whole slice is usually stained and activity is evoked by electrical
        stimulation.</p>

        of this movie. At first, the electrical stimulation evoked action potentials in
        the axons located in the SR. Action potentials propagated forward to the subiculum
        and backward to the CA2 region. These action potentials triggered the release of
        neurotransmitters (glutamate) from presynaptic terminals. These neurotransmitters
        binded to postsynaptic receptors and evoked excitatory postsynaptc potentials (EPSPs),
        which propagated along apical dendrites to the soma and triggered action potentials
        in the axon initial segments. These action potentials propagated to both the basal
        dendrites (in the SO) and the apical dendrites (in the SR).</p>

    <h2>
        Long-term Potentiation (LTP) in The Hippocampal CA1 Region</h2>
    <p class="indent">
        Long-term potentiation (LTP) means that the synaptic strength increases for a long
        period of time after some neuronal activities. In general, increase in synaptic
        strength for longer than 30 to 60 minutes is considered sufficient to be called
        LTP. Temporary increase in synaptic strength shorter than 30 minutes is called short-term
        potentiation (STP).</p>
    <p class="indent">
        LTP is one of the major mechanisms underlying learning and memory. When LTP is inhibited
        by pharmacological methods or genetic manipulation, the learning capacity of the
        animal is compromised.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        Field potential recording and whole-cell recording are good tools to study LTP either
        at a specific location or in a single neuron. However, they are not sufficient to
        study LTP at the neural network level. Instead, voltage imaging can provide spatiotemporal
        information of membrane potential change and thus is a better technique to study
        the characteristics of LTP in a neural network.</p>

    <p class="indent">
        The figure on the right displays an example of voltage imaging on LTP in the hippocampal
        CA1 region.
        Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) protocol was used to induce LTP (TBS contains 
        three trains separated by 20 seconds. One train contains ten bursts at 5 Hz. One 
        burst contains five pulses at 100 Hz.). Both field potential recording (FP) and 
        voltage imaging confirmed the expression of LTP. In field potential traces, the 
        initial slope became steeper and the amplitude of population spike became larger 
        after TBS. In voltage imaging traces, the amplitude of spikes contributed 
        significantly to the increase in signals. The spatial distribution of LTP can be 
        calculated by subtracting the baseline amplitude distribution from the amplitude 
        distribution after TBS. You can see that the spatial pattern of LTP is 
        heterogeneous. In this particular example, there were four regions expressing 
        stronger LTP.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        The discovery of heterogeneous distribution of LTP is quite surprising. The 
        distribution of LTP is different from that of the amplitude in response to the 
        test stimulation, which contains one electric pulse. The difference between 
        these two distributions suggests that the neural network activated during TBS is 
        different from that activated during the test stimulation. Further analysis 
        confirmed that the spatial pattern of responses during TBS matched that of LTP. 
        In addition, the amplitude of spikes during TBS was correlated with the strength 
        of LTP, indicating spikes are critical for LTP induction.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        Theta oscillation is prominent when an animal (mammal) is exploring its 
        environment. Some CA1 pyramidal neurons generate action potentials at their 
        specific places. These neurons are called place cells. The relative timing 
        between the firing of place cells and the theta oscillation is related to the 
        relative positions of the animal and the specific place. Thus, during 
        navigation, different ensembles of neurons fire, which depend on both the 
        location of the animal and the ongoing theta oscillation. Therefore, it is 
        conceivable that theta-burst stimulation mimics the physiological activities 
        during navigation and produces LTP in a specific ensemble of activated neurons, 
        which is revealed by voltage imaging. It is likely that inhibitory interneurons 
        also participate in the generation of the LTP patterns since inhibition is 
        important in determining the size of LTP and interneurons are critical for 
        timing the firing of pyramidal neurons.</p>

        Epileptic Activities in The Hippocampus</h2>

        The hippocampus is 
        critical for our memory formation. Unfortunately, it is also susceptible to the generation of seizures. To provide better 
        treatments for epilepsy patients, we need to know where and how these epileptic

        The figure on the right displays an example of one epileptic activity as well as 
        one non-epileptic activity in a hippocampal slice, which was stained with 
        voltage-sensitive dye. The response was evoked by an electrical stimulation in 
        the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        In hippocampal slices, epileptic discharges generally initiate in the CA3 
        region. After onset, discharges abruptly appeare in the CA1 region, right at 
        the CA2 border. This spread from the CA3 region to the CA1 region is saltatory, 
        occurring before detectable activity in the intervening CA2 and CA3 regions. 
        Discharges do eventually propagate smoothly through the intervening CA3 region 
        into the CA2 region, but on a slower timescale. The surge in the CA1 region do 
        not spread back into the CA2 region, but spread through the CA1 region toward 
        the subiculum.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        The spatiotemporal pattern of the epileptic acitivity in the hippocampal slice 
        is stereotypical. After stimulation, there is a latency before the onset of 
        seizures. During this latent period, there is a local neural activity in the CA3 
        region, which can be identified in the voltage imaging signals. This local 
        activity is through connections between CA3 pyramidal neurons, which form 
        positive feedback loops. Due to this unique circuitry, the level of neural 
        activity keeps increasing and later reachs a threshold, which triggers 
        synchronized firing of CA3 pyramidal neurons and initiates epileptiform 
        discharges.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        The propagation of epileptiform acitivities in the hippocampal slice is through 
        two routes. The first is through the associative connections between CA3 
        pyramidal neurons. The propagation through this route is slower due to the 
        involvement of a series of action potentials and synaptic transmissions. In 
        detail, the initial activated CA3 pyramidal neurons generate action potentials, 
        which propagate to presynaptic terminals and trigger the release of 
        neurotransmitters onto nearby CA3 pyramidal neurons. These events evoke 
        excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), which trigger the firing of nearby 
        innervated neurons. Then, these nearby neurons activate their own nearby 
        neurons, and so on. Since this route involves a lot of synaptic transmissions 
        and the accumulation of EPSPs to trigger action potentials, the propagation is 
        slow. The second route is through the Schaffer collaterals and is much faster. 
        The initial activated CA3 pyramidal neurons generate action potentials, which 
        propagate to the CA1 region through Schaffer collaterals and activate CA1 
        pyramidal neurons. Since this route involves only one synaptic transmission, it 
        is much faster than the first route. In the example on the right, you can notice 
        that the epileptic acitivity initiated in the CA3 region reached the CA1 region 
        before it arrived in the CA2 region.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        Voltage imaging reveals that different regions in the hippocampal slice play 
        different roles in the onset and spread of epileptiform discharges. It also 
        provids the valuable information about the connections and properties of the 
        neural circuitry involved in seizures. This research suggests that we might be 
        able to target the middle CA3 region to prevent the initiation of seizures, or 
        to target the proximal CA1 region to block the propagation of seizures.</p>
