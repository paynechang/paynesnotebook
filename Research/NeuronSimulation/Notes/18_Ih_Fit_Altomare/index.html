    <h2>
        Goals: Modify Altomare&#39;s model</h2>
    <h2>
        Specific Aims:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Find new sets of parameters to fit Magee&#39;s data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Notes:</h2>
    <p>
        Altomare&#39;s model produces Ih with a depolarized vhalf and shallower slope factor compared to Magee&#39;s data. I don&#39;t know which model is better. One 
        thing I think worth to try is to find sets of parameters that produce Ih with similar vhalf and slope factor as in Magee&#39;s paper and see whether it 
        can reproduce electrophysiology experiments.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I tried to find alpha_0, beta_0, gamma_0, and delta_0 so the GV curve fits to Magee&#39;s data. The code is in <a href="P0_Fit.hoc">P0_Fit.hoc</a>. You 
            will find values of alpha_0, beta_0, and gamma_0 are between the values of HCN1 and HCN2. Delta_0 is a little higher than both the values of HCN1 and 
            HCN2.</li>
        <li>Since delta_0 is larger than both the values of HCN1 and HCN2 but the values of HCN1 and HCN2 are close, I assumed delta_0 is the average of the 
            values of HCN1 and HCN2 and tried to find the best fit. <a href="P0_Fit_2.hoc">P0_Fit_2.hoc</a> contains the code to find the parameters.</li>
        <li>After simulating electrophysiology experiments, I found the time constant is about three folds slower than Magee&#39;s data. I decided to use alpha_0 and 
            beta_0 from HCN1. Delta_0 is the average of the values of HCN1 and HCN2. A fitting process is used to find gamma_0, which is two orders different 
            between HCN1 and HCN2. The code is in <a href="P0_Fit_3.hoc">P0_Fit_3.hoc</a>.</li>
        <li>A comparison of several models are presented in tutorial #19.</li>
