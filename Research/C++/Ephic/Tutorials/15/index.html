                    the EDT DV C-link frame grabber, check &quot;EDT&quot; button. If the EDT frame 
                    grabber is connected, the &quot;CCD Settings&quot; 
                    panel will become active.</p>

                    You can select one of eight programs for your experiment by clicking &quot;Program 
                    No.&quot; and select the right one. In this example, the camera will acquire imaging 
                    data at 500 Hz from 80 x 80 pixels, no binning.</p>

                <p>
                    This CCD camera has four quads (#0, #1, #2, and #4). There are two identical but 
                    independent circuits controlling the gain, the filter, clamp delay, and sample 
                    delay of these quads. The first circuit (#0, left) controls quads #0 and #1. The 
                    second circuit (#1, right) controls quads #2 and #3. In general, you will set 
                    the gain and the filter of these circuits to the same values. The gain controls 
                    the amplification of the signals (0: highest; 3: lowest). The filter controls 
                    low pass filters in the circuits. The filter setting usually follows the 
                    acquisition rate. The clamp delay and the sample delay are used to optimize the 
                    CCD camera circuit to achieve the best signal to noise ratio. You can load the 
                    factory settings from the memory in the camera and these settings should be 
                    good. The offsets are used to set the background level. You can ask Ephic to 
                    automaticlly calibrate offsets by closing the shutter and click &quot;Find&quot; 
                    button.</p>
                <p>
                    There are eight saved settings in the camera memory. To load one of these 
                    settings to the camera, type in the setting number (0~8) in &quot;Recall Settings&quot; 
                    box and press &quot;Enter&quot;. You can change Baud Rate by typing the value in &quot;Baud 
                    Rate&quot; box and press &quot;Enter&quot;. 38400 is the default value.</p>
                <p>
                    There are three external control modes: local control (0), freeze mode (1), and 
                    repeat mode (2). Local control is the default. To change the external control 
                    mode, click &quot;External Control&quot; and select.</p>
                <p>
                    You can check the temperatures at the case, CCD #1, and CCD #2 by clicking 
                    &quot;Check&quot; button.</p>
                <p>
                    &quot;Create Offset Map&quot; and &quot;Create Map Set&quot; buttons are for engineers to optimize 
                    the settings in clamp delay and sample delay.</p>
