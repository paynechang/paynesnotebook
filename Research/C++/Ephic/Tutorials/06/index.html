                To remove the capacitance introduced by the pipette, we adjust the knob in the 
                amplifier to make the slope of the initial voltage trace as steep as possible, 
                but not to cause oscillation. When you start to see ripples after the edge of 
                the falling voltage, the setting of the capacitance compensation is too much. 
                Back off a bit so you don&#39;t see ripples.</td>

                To remove the 
                Rs indroduced by the pipette, adjust the bridge 
                balance knob in the amplifier so you don&#39;t see the sharp edge in the voltage 
                trace at the beginning 
                of current injection. At this point, the capacitance and the Rs 
                of the pipette are well compensated.</td>

                During experiments, it is often that the Rs of the 
                pipette changed due to various reasons (for example, clogs acculumate at the 
                tip). Therefore, it is a common practice to monitor Rs and make appropriate 
                adjustments so that the change in Rs does not affect the measurements. In 
                general, this works well. However, if continuous monitoring and correction of Rs 
                is not feasible for the experiment, an alternative is to correct it offline. By 
                giving a test current pulse and measuring the deviation from the original 
                corrected voltage trace, we can calculate the change in Rs. With this 
                information, we can correct the voltage trace according to the calculated change 
                in Rs.</td>

                The figure on the right gives an example of how improper Rs compensation affects 
                voltage measurement. In this example, the amplifier is measureing voltage 
                in response to one hyperpolarizing current pulse (0.2 ~ 0.4 ms) and one 
                depolarizing current pulse (0.7 ~ 0.9 ms). The Rs of the pipette is 10 MOhm. 
                When the bridge balance is correctly set to 10 MOhm (red), the recorded voltage 
                reflects the real voltage of the cell. When the bridge balance is set to 8 MOhm 
                (black), the Rs is under-compensated and the voltage is deviated from the real 
                voltage during current injection. When the bridge balance is set to 12 MOhm 
                (green), Rs is over-compensated and the recorded voltage is also deviated from 
                the real voltage. Rs does not affect voltage measurement where there is no current 
                injection.</td>
