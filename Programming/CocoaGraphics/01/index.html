    <h1>
        1.
        Draw a Rectangle and Two Points
        - From Creating A Project to Drawing</h1>
    <p>
        <a href="../index.html">Back to Cocoa Graphics table of contents</a></p>
    <hr />
    <p>
        This tutorial will show you 
        the steps from creating a project to drawing a rectangle 
        and two points. Xcode 4.5.2 was used here. I assume you know the basics 
        of Objective-C.</p>
    <p>
        The focus of this tutorial is to show you the steps to draw primitive 
        shapes in a view. Therefore, I will avoid using other techniques not related to 
        Cocoa graphics. In addition, I will not try to draw beautiful things for now. 
        These extra efforts might distract you from graphics. However, I encourage you 
        to play with the code and see the effects, which is a great way to REALLY learn 
        graphics and any other programming techniques. After you gaining the knowledge and skills about Cocoa graphics, you 
        will be able to enjoy generating beautiful drawings and maybe share them with the world.</p>
    <p>
        As the title mentioned, I will show you how to create a project, create a view 
        class, and draw a rectangle and a few points.</p>

    <h2>
        Create the basic structure of the program</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Launch Xcode.</li>
        <li>Select menu: &quot;File &gt; New &gt; Project...&quot;.</li>
        <li>Select &quot;OS X &gt; Application &gt; Cocoa Application&quot; template. Click &quot;Next&quot;.</li>
        <li>Fill the dialog similar to the following figure. Click &quot;Next&quot;.<br />
            <img class="style14" src="Figures/01.png" /></li>
        <li>Select a location for the project. Click &quot;Create&quot; with default settings.</li>
        <li>Click &quot;Run&quot; and you will see a window like the following figure.<br />
            <img class="style2" src="Figures/02.png" /></li>
        <li>Select menu: &quot;RectangleAndPoint &gt; Quit RectangleAndPoint&quot; to quick this program 
            for now. The basic structure of the program is done.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>
        Create a customed view class - MyView, 
        and draw a blue rectangle</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Select &quot;RectangleAndPoint&quot; folder in the Project Navigator<br />
            <img class="style3" src="Figures/03.png" /><br />
        </li>
        <li>Select menu: &quot;File &gt; New &gt; File...&quot;.</li>
        <li>Select &quot;OS X &gt; Cocoa &gt; Objective-C class&quot; and click &quot;Next&quot;.</li>
        <li>Complete the dialog like the following figure and click &quot;Next&quot;.<br />
            <img class="style4" src="Figures/05.png" /><br />
        </li>
        <li>Click &quot;Create&quot; with default settings.</li>
        <li>Revise &quot;MyView.m &gt; drawRect:&quot; so it looks like the 
            following.<br />
            <img class="style5" src="Figures/06.png" /><ul>
                <li>In this code, we first created a rectangle, myRect. (20, 10) is the position of 
                    the origin. 200 is the width and 100 is the height.</li>
                <li>We need to set the color before we draw anything. Otherwise, the default color 
                    or the previous used color is used. Here, we set the color to blue.</li>
                <li>The last line of code filled the rectangle with the set color.</li>
                <li>By the way, the default origin of the view is the bottom left corner. Similarly, 
                    the origin of a rectangle is the lower left corner.</li>
                <li>Notice that the length unit of the coordination is 1/72 inch. Therefore, 72 
                    units correspond to one inch and 0.1 unit corresponds to 1/720 inch on the 
                    screen.<br /></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Select &quot;MainMenu.xib&quot; in the Project Navigator.</li>
        <li>Select &quot;Window - RectangleAndPoint&quot;.<br />
            <img class="style15" src="Figures/04.png" /><br />
        </li>
        <li>In &quot;Object library&quot; pan, type in &quot;Custom View&quot; in the search bar. You shoud see 
            something similar to the following.<br />
            <img class="style16" src="Figures/07.png" /><br />
        </li>
        <li>Drag &quot;Custom View&quot; from the &quot;Object library&quot; to the RectangleAndPoint window. 
            The result will be 
            similar to the following.<br />
            <img class="style8" src="Figures/09.png" /><br />
        </li>
        <li>Adjust the position and the size of the &quot;Custom View&quot; so it looks like:<br />
            <img class="style17" src="Figures/08.png" /><br />
        </li>
        <li>When &quot;Custom View&quot; is selected, select &quot;Identity inspector&quot; and select/type in 
            &quot;MyView&quot;, like the following:<br />
            <img class="style10" src="Figures/11.png" /><br />
        </li>
        <li>Click &quot;Run&quot; and you will see a blue rectangle in your window.<br />
            <img class="style18" src="Figures/10.png" /></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        Draw two points</h2>
    <p>To my knowledge, there is no native support for drawing a point. Instead, we can 
        use rect to draw a point. In the following code, the <span class="code">
        drawRect:</span> function is revised to change the background to black and draw 
        a white point. An additional function, <span class="code">drawPointAtX: andY:</span>, was created to draw a 
        red point at (x, y). The following is the revised code:</p>
    <p>
        <img class="style12" src="Figures/14.png" /></p>
    <p>
        The following is the result.</p>
    <p>
        <img class="style13" src="Figures/13.png" /></p>
    <p>
        And, the following is the zipped final project.</p>
